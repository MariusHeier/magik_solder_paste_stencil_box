# magik_solder_paste_stencil_box
Is it magik?  Or is it just a 3d printed box for holding your solder stencils with automatic lifting and normal vacuum cleaner hold down?

# Warning:
If your computer suck, like my M1 mini. Changing the box width/length can take some time in Fusion360. Be patient, it did crash.

# Questions?
